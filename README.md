 CodeClause Internship-Project 1 : Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering
 
Data Preprocessing:
Feature Scaling was performed using StandardScaler to normalize the data before clustering.

Visualizations:
Plots were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the clusters or data distribution.

Machine Learning Algorithm:
KMeans Clustering was applied to group data into clusters based on similarity
